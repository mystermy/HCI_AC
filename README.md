# HCI_AC Blade Forge Simulator

This project is a small browser game that simulates forging a sword. It uses timed study
and rest phases where you must remain in or out of fullscreen as instructed.

Open `forge/index.html` in your browser to play. Choose the number of rounds and the
length of each study and rest phase. During studying you should stay in fullscreen,
whereas the rest period takes place outside of fullscreen.

If you leave fullscreen during a study phase or remain in fullscreen during rest,
a timer will appear giving you 30 seconds to correct the issue before the blade breaks.

At the end of a successful forging session you can name your blade and it will be
saved to the list of forged swords.

All code runs in the browser; no additional setup is required.
